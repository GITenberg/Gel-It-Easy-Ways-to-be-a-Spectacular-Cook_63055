<p>What is gelatine? Unflavored gelatine is colorless, odorless, and
tasteless. Knox Gelatine is a granulated protein substance derived
from the long bones of cattle. It is pure protein consisting of 17
amino acids ... among them 7 out of the 8 essential to good diet.
(Commercially flavored gelatines, on the other hand, consist of
&#8542; sugar and flavorings and only &#8539; gelatine.) Unflavored gelatine
takes on the flavors and colors you choose, when combined in
dishes to your taste. For extra style in a dish, gel it!</p>
<h3><img class="inline" src="images/i-timer.png" alt="quick-gel" width="60" height="62" /> new 30-minute gel!</h3>
<p>Now you can cook the modern way&mdash;fast!&mdash;with gelatine. The new
quick-gel method takes advantage of modern refrigeration and
food products, to prepare gelatine dishes that are ready to serve
minutes after you stir them together! After gelatine is softened,
then dissolved in hot liquid, add frozen juices, fruits or soups, ice
cream or ice cubes as part of the liquid. The frozen food or cubes
will melt and quick-chill the gelatine, resulting in gels within half
an hour! You&rsquo;ll find new quick-gel recipes throughout this booklet.</p>

<br /><span class="smallest">cooking with gelatine is as easy as 1-2-3.</span></h2>
<p class="revint"><b><span class="xxlarge">1</span></b> An envelope of gelatine will gel 1 pint of liquid. First,
choose the liquid you will use&mdash;water, juice, broth, milk
or other as designated in recipes which follow. Sprinkle
gelatine from the envelope over &frac12; cup of cold liquid and
let stand a few minutes to soften. If sugar is to be added,
stir sugar with the gelatine before you begin. (If 1 tablespoon
or more of sugar is added, the gelatine-sugar mixture
may be softened and dissolved directly in hot liquid.)</p>
<p class="revint"><b><span class="xxlarge">2</span></b> Stir softened gelatine over medium heat until mixture
is clear and gelatine dissolved, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove from heat and add remaining liquid or, for new
quick-gel method, add frozen juice, fruit, etc.</p>
<p class="revint"><b><span class="xxlarge">3</span></b> Pour into mold or serving dish, chill until set. This takes
2 to 4 hours, or may be cut down to &frac12; hour or less when
made the new quick-gel way. Smaller molds set faster.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">gels clear and airy</span></h2>
<p>When gelatine is dissolved in a clear liquid it makes a shimmering
clear gel, with smooth texture. Gels are delicious plain, or you may
add contrast by incorporating solids before the gel is completely
set. Or turn out light and frothy dishes by incorporating air. For a
whip, simply beat any partially set gelatine with a rotary beater, then
chill. Or, add beaten egg whites, whipped cream or whipped evaporated
milk, or such ready-beaten mixtures as mayonnaise and ice
cream to make mousses, creamy molds, and other specialties. Tips
to make this easy:</p>
<h3>how to beat...</h3>
<p>At a slightly thickened consistency, clear gelatine can be turned
into an airy, frothy mixture. Whip the gelatine with rotary or electric
beater until it is light and fluffy, then chill firm. Or add egg
whites and beat all together to make an especially frothy &ldquo;snow.&rdquo;
(See <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a> for recipes.)</p>
<h3>how to set...</h3>
<p>To set gelatine, just put the mold in the refrigerator. To add solids,
chill gelatine mixture until slightly thickened, to prevent solids
from rising to the top or sinking to the bottom. When gelatine
mixture reaches the consistency of unbeaten egg white, you can
fold in cut-up drained fruits, vegetables, meats or other solids,
whipped milk (evaporated or nonfat solids) or cream. Then chill.</p>
<p>For an extra-fast set, first put mold in the freezer for 5 minutes.
Or, put bowl or pan of gelatine mixture into a container of ice and
water and stir mixture for 5 minutes, until it begins to thicken.
Then chill in refrigerator.</p>
<h3>how to unmold...</h3>
<p>Dip mold briefly into warm (not hot!) water just to level of gelatine
mixture. Run the tip of a knife around edge of gelatine. Rinse
a serving plate in cold water (makes it easier to slide mold to
center of plate), place plate on top of the mold, invert plate and
mold together, and shake gently to loosen gelatine. Lift off mold,
slide gelatine into place in center of plate. Presto! A snack or main
dish, salad or dessert with form and style!</p>

<p>Dessert is often the star of the meal&mdash;and you can quickly learn to
select a superb dessert recipe first, then plan a meal which will
lead up to your grand finale.</p>
<p>As you begin to prepare and serve meals, it may seem you need
some magic power to have all dishes and courses ready to serve
at the right time. A gelatine dessert can be your abra-cadabra&mdash;prepare
it ahead, have it ready in the refrigerator at serving time.</p>
<p>This advance preparation need no longer require hours of chilling!
With new quick-gel ways of preparing gelatine desserts with frozen
foods such as juices, ice cream and frozen fruits, you can stir together
a quick fruit mold or a berry-cream pie and have it ready
to unmold or slice and serve within minutes! Gelatine captures
the full flavor of these refreshing foods, makes it easier than ever
to serve a special dessert.</p>
<p>In selecting a dessert, remember&mdash;dessert should complete the
meal in a complementary, contrasting way. Dessert should be light
and refreshing after a lengthy, filling meal; it can be hearty and
satisfying when the meal before has been light. Unflavored gelatine
takes on your favorite flavor in any type of dessert, from feather-weight
snows and whips to rich, creamy pies and cakes.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
